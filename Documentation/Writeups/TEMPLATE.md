When including raw text, commands, or code, please use single or tripe backticks (\`) to format it. Single backticks are for inline code or commands, while triple backticks are for code blocks. An example of single backticks is `echo "Hello, World!"`, and an example of triple backticks for raw text is:

``` 
This is a bunch of raw text
Never gonna give you up
``` 

Here an an example of triple backticks for Python code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
``` 

And an example for triple backticks for shell commands:

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
