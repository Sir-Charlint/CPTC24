# UML CPTC 24 Team 

This is the 2024 UML CPTC team's repository.

It has the following Organization
1. Templates used for general tasks, write-ups, and communications are stored in the [Documents/](./Documentation/) folder.
2. Platform specific documentation, and scripts are stored in their own directory. For example the *Golden Ticket* writeup attacking a *Windows* machine is stored in [Platform-Windows/GoldenTicket](./Platform-Windows/GoldenTicket/), if you include Images they would need to be stored in a *Images* folder in the same directory as the README they are used in.
3. Critical services like Websites and Databases will have documentation in their own directory with the same structure as the platforms. For example *Dirbuster* would be stored in [Service-Websites/Dirbuster](./Service-Websites/DIRBUSTER/).
